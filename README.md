# Virtual-LAN-VLAN-Development-for-Commercial-Bank
Developed a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) for a commercial bank to ensure secure and efficient internal communication. In this project ive creat a VLAN fro a multi Storey Commercial Bank by using Cisco Packet Tracer. Our network management project focused on VLAN implementation and DHCP services, brings forth a structured and efficient solution tailored to our banking environment. The Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) architecture divides our banking facility into three distinct floors, each dedicated to a specific department: Accountant, Business Banking, and Loan Department. This segmentation improves network performance and streamlines communication between departments.
